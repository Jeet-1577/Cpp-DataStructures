continue:

its used for skiping the iteration

meance,

        if the loop has five value
                1
                2
                3
                4
                5

        and the loop will iterate this values 5 times

        now if we add the continue in the middle it will skip the next values from the continue and itrate the all the vlues before the continue


                    1
                    2
                    continue;

                    3
                    4
                    5

                    ==12121212

                    so here the values after continue was skipped
